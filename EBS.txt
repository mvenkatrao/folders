EBS - ec2 will have EBS volume as a root volume
each EBS volume capacity --> 16 TB


if we want to attach first 

we should create volumes

- One EBS can't be attached to multiple servers while in use


- > we should create the volume first
- >  we can check the storage by using below command for block storage
   lsblk

-> we should create a folder and we should mount that volume to it

-> we should format also
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf



- when we create with snap shot with policy aws will take care of the data like cronjob



mkdir -p $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/
cd $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/
touch ./system.yaml
chown -R 1030:1030 $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var


docker run --name artifactory -v $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory -d -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 releases-docker.jfrog.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:7.77.5


EFS (NFS)

Elastic file system NFS (Network file system)


we should install nfs client software on the system then we should mount like below

Port 2049 we should enable


sudo apt install nfs-common -y

mkdir nfsserverfolder
command to mount (we will get it from the efs section in aws)

we can use this efs for web servers to sync with static files


sudo mount /dev/xvdf /var/lib/jenkins

sudo systemctl start jenkins

sudo cat /etc/fstab 

sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig
sudo blkid

redhat
---------
sudo blkid
sudo lsblk -o +UUID --> this is for ubuntu


after we get the ID we should take that ID number of the device

sudo vi /etc/fstab

UUID=<that number here> /var/lib/jenkins ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2

to check we can use

sudo unmount /var/lib/jenkins

sudo mount -a --> this should get attach back to for permanently


to clean up we can use below command

#df -hk /

sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf



to unmount to another server we can use below options

sudo systemctl stop jenkins
sudo umount /var/lib/jenkins
- detaching from the server that EBS volume

sudo file -s /dev/xvdf --> this is the command to check either files are there or not
