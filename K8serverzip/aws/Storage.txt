Block Storge (SAN) Storage Area Network
File Store (NAS) Network-attached storage
Object Store 


How many buckets can be created in one account by default ?
1-- (SoftLimit)

what is max file size in s3?
5 TB


enabling the access or making the public access to each object is kind of stupid to avoid AWS introduced one feature called  bucket policies


Resource means: to which object you want to grant the access

ARN : Amazon Resource Name

arn:aws:servicetype:region:a.z:<resource>
Action: what action can be taken dlete update like that 
Effect : there are only two objects either deny or allow
Princial Means: whom you are giving the access
Sid: AllowReadOnlyForEveryOne

  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "ReadObly",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowReadOnlyForSpecificIP",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::idibuckets3/*",

          "aws:SourceIp": "117.99.244.53"

Versioning
#############


when we upload same object that will get overwriten
it will not maintain when we want to maintain the all the objects with old objects also we should enable the versioning under properties


StorageClasses
###################

Standard  --> frequently access data can be maintain under standard --> high avaialbe and high retrive rate 
         - They will maintain multiple copies 

StandardIA --> InFrequently access data can be maintained in IA. it will be maintain in multiple zones also
OneZoneIA --> it will be maintain only in one zone
RRS   --> Reduced Redundancy storage. Non Crictical & Reproducable data
Glacier --> Archival/historical Data. (Deep storage) 
  InstantGlacier --> quicly we can retrive the data
  DeepGlacier --> it will take sometime


Requirement
################


First 60 days of object creation it has be in standard
After 60 days of Object creation Standard IA
After 365 days delete that object

previsous versions

30 days of object become none current Standard IA
after 365 days delete that object
Retain only last 5 versions


Object Life Cycle Rules:
##########################

We can move the Objects to the StorageClasses and we can set the Expiry also under management

before we are moving it required 30 days to keep
when keep on uploading the versions we can set how many retain of the latest we can set there
