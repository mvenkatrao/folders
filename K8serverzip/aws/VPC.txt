VPC is a private sub-section of aws that you control, in which you place aws resources.
you have full control over who has access to the aws resources that you place inside our VPC.
VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the aws cloud where you launch aws resources ina virtual netowrk.
in the VPC we can control our virtual networking environment,ip address, creation of subnets, route table & gateways.
wjen we create an aws account a default vpc is created for you

VPC - User defined address spaces up to /16 (65,536 address)
subnets - 200 user-defined subnets up to /16
Route tables - define how traffic should be routed from/to each subnet
access control list - stateless netowrking filtering between subnets
internet gateway - a logical device enabling traffic to be routed to/s from the public internet
NAT provide network adress translation to private instances for 10 Gbps traffic




NAT instances will be on public network NAT wil talk to the IGW
Load balancer will be running on public network

what is Public Subnet?
The subnet which has route to to IGW (Internet) in route table is called public subnet. The servers which are created under public subnet has access to internet. From internet we can also reach to the servers

what is private subnet? 
The subnet which does'nt have route to IGW (Internet) in route table is called as private subnet.

if a subnet is having routes we can consider as a public

IGW --> Internet Gateway. It's a virtual router which enbles internet connection to your vpc


Route Table
##############

RT contains a set of rules, called routes that are used to determine where the network traffic is directed
Te default VPC already has a main route table
Unline an IGW you can have multiple active route tables in a VPC
you cannot delte a route table if it has "dependencies"

Private Ip is desinged with 

what is an RFC1918 address?
###############################


AN RFC1918 address is an ip address tat is assigned by an enterprise organization to an internal host These ip address are used in private netowrks
which are not availables from the internet


10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8) prefix
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
192.168.0.0 - 192.16.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)



How end users will access the application which are placed in private network?


we will be having one ELB which is placed in public network this ELB will talk to the private network 
we can enable the internet connection only from the NAT instance

What is NAT when do you create nat?

Ans: if private servers need access to internet we can crate NAT. define routing from private subnet to NAT in R.T.so private servers will get access to the internet using NAT.
NAT is an optional



Firewall at subnet level
ACL/NACL network access controll list

security group is server level firewall


what is NAT when do you create nat?
IF private servers need access to the internet we can create NAT. define routing from private subnet to NAT in R.T.so private subnet to NAT in R.T.so private servers will get access to internet via NAT.


NACL/ACL is a subnet level firewall either we can allow or deny the request

Only one IGW can be attached to the one vpc at a time


First 4 & last 1 ip will be reserved by aws

Actual IPS available =  Total IPS - 5* Number os subnets

First 4 and last one will be used by aws

1. 10.0.0.0 - Network address.
2. 10.0.0.1 - Reserved by aws for the vpc router.
3. 10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS . The IP address of the DNS server is alwsys the base of the VPC network range plus two.
4. 10.0.0.3 - Reserved by AWS for future use.
5. 10.0.0.255 - Network broadcase addresses. we do not support broadcase in a VPC. therefore we reserver this address
