1. While creating subnets also we have define CIDR for subnet.
subnet CIDR should be sub set of VPC CIDR.


Below is for CIDR range

32 -n 	32 - 24 	32 - 8


 =2     =2		=2

Actual IPS avaialbe = Total IPS -5 * Number of subnets


##########################################################


 VPC has subnets
Subnets (Subnetworks)
Public Subnets -->  The subnet which has access to IGW(Internet).
IGW (Internet gate way)
Route Table
NAT Gateway/NAT instance --> Network address translator
ACL/NACL (Network access controll) --> firewall at subnets level


how a request reach to the private server?
###########################################

whenever a user request that will go to the load balancer which is placed in public server 


actual IP's available = Total IP's - 5* number of subnets
in each and every ip 5 ips will be  reserved

1. Network address
2. Reserved by aws for the vpc router
3. Reserved by aws. The ip address of the DNS server is alway sthe base of the VPC network range plus two
4. Reserved by aws for future use.
5. Network broadcse address. we do not support broadcaset in vpc , therefore we reserve this address
