if we want our instance should access to only particular services in aws from the instance level we can configure the roles like below

go to the aws roles and select which service that belongs to
attach the required policies to that role attach that role to the instance by modifying IAM role

we can make the group of instance as a resource group in the session manager to collect the multiple instances
- we can execute the commands without loggin also using this session manager
- and we can store that output into s3 also and cloud watch logs also
- we can make the patch policy also using system manager

Placement Group

Cluster - Means it will take same hardware same power supply whnever we launch any istances
 we can create the partitions for placement group mostly for hadop

Rack Spread level placement groups

when we launch any servers that will lanunch in only one rack

we can't lanunch the instance with placement groups if already instance is running or already lanunched if really want we can create one golden ami from that we can lanunch

- placement group steps
- we should create the placement group
- we should go the consul while lanunching we can select the placement group

- to protect the instance we can enable the encryption whenever a instance is lanunching that ebs will be encrypted
