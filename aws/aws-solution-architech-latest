IAM 
####

Identity access management


- if we don't want to remember the account id we can make it alias 
- if we want to give only to particular resrouces we cna do that by creating the groups 
- if we want to assign the policy from existing user we can do that by using 2nd options
- if we want to attach directly the policies we can use 3rd options
- if we want to manage the user password streghth we can go to the account settings


- if we create any user with admin access he can do anything xcept 


- to give the billing access

 - Go to My accooun my account -> there we can enable or else we can add below policy
 - Billing
 - Explore the free tier below
 https://aws.amazon.com/free
 
 
 - single sign on - Pending
 - secret center - pending
 
 - the document written in the json format this is called policy
 
 
 we have three types of policies
 - Customer managed - this is managed by customer
 - AWS managed - managed by aws invidual policies
 
 - AWS managed - Job function -> predefined policies example for networking admin all the collected policies
 
 
 - we can use one condition for one bucket only for on one networking
 - we can take
 
- if we want to restrict the access only for one bucket like upload and delete only for one bucket we can do below steps
- we should go to the policies there we can select the s3

- Put Object
- DeleteObject

- we should select particular select specific in resource tab
 - there we we can add the arn number
 
 
 we can attach the policies from the policy page also under Entity

 Ec2
 #####
 
 on-demand is pay as you go model
 Reserved instances -> reserving the servers
  - standard reserved instances -> it can modify
  - convertable reserved instances -> we can modify the instance configuration
  
  
  
Spot Instances
#################

this is kind of bidding 
this instance will may go away any time


Dedicated Hosts

we can have the instance dedicadedly

 Compute optimized -> for better cpu
 
 
 Memory optimized -> Better Ram
 
 storage optimized --> it will use for more I/o 
 HPC optimized --> for deep learning

 when we attach the volume to the instance we should verify by using below commands
 ###########################################################################################
 
 to verify the mounts
 lsblk
 
 df -Th --> to see the disk usages
 
 file -s /dev/xvdf -> command to check if any files are contains or not we can check using below command 
 
 file -s /dev/xvdf -> if it shows only like data --> means there is no file system
 if it shows something else means it contains the file system
 
 
 to create the file system below is the command
 
 
 mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
 this file system will be stored in /dev/ 
 
 
 -> now we should mount mount that to one folder
 mkdir extravolume/
 sudo mount /dev/xvdf extravolume/
 --> now we should make it permenenly 
 
 -> we should open cat /etc/mtab
 /dev/xvdf /home/ubuntu/extravolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0
 
 vi /etc/fstab -> here we should add above entry 
 
 mount -all
 
 
 xfs_growfs -d /dev/xvdf
 
 
 
 chkconfig httpd on -> this is for redhat whenever instance is restarted it will start the httpd service automatically
 
 /var/www/html  --> we can deploy here
 
 configuration /etc/nginx/site-available  --> configurations
 
 #######################################################################################
 
 snapshot
 #########
 
 we can create the snapshot from the volume and we can attach to any instance 
 - we can also create multiple volumes from one snapshot
 - we can move this volume to multiple region also and there we can create the volume
 
 - the snapshots are getting stored in s3 buckets of aws
 
 if we have any volume without encryption we can follow below steps
 
 - we can go to the snapshots
 - we can create the volunme from the same snapshot there we can encrypt the snapshot


lifecycle manager
Data lifecycle manager
###################

it works with labels and selectors (tags)
- we can exclude the root volume also --> because it contains the os
retain
#####
recent 10 snapshots will be available


age -> we can keep the days


requirement
