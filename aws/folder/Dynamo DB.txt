Dynamo DB is a classified a no sql data base

Amazon DynamoDB is managed NOSQL service with strong consistency and predictable perfomance that shields users from the complexities of manual steps

- it can handle more than 10 trillion requests per second 

DynamoDB Table items:
#######################

items in the table can either contain scaler attributes which means it contains only one value like strings, numbers, or binary or the could have nested attributes.

Nested attributes are like a map of key-value pairs DynamoDB supports up to 32 levels of nested attrinbutes


Understanding DynamoDB primary Keys
#######################################

now to understand the different types of primary keys, let's look at two types of keys that can exist

1. partition Key : This key is used to identify the partition on which the data is stored
2. Sort Key: This key is used to identify the location of the items in the parition


Using these two keys we can create the one primary key in two ways

1. Simple Primary Key - This only contains one attributes to define the primary key. This attributes itself becomes that partiion key

2.Composite primary key


Dynamo DB can be created in two ways

1. Provisioned Mode
2. On Demand Mode

Provisioned Mode:
###############

1.it defines the maximum amount of capacity that an application can use from a specified table.
2. In Provisioned mode , you need to specify the number of reads and write per seconds by the application. And pay based on the allocated capacity 
3. A provisioned mode is goo for the application that have predictable and consistent traffic.


On-Demand
========

1. if we are not sure about the traffic we can go for the on-demand
