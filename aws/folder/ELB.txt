Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributres incoming application traffic across multiple targets. such as Amazon Ec2 Instances, Containers, Or Ip addresses in Your VPC.

- It will distributes the traffic within a same region
- It's regional level service
- it can be in diffrent availability zone



 Network Load Balancer (layer 4 TCP/UDP)
 Application Load Balancer (Layer 7 HTTP/HTTPS)
Classic Load Balancer - it's layer 4 and layer 7 


OSI Layers
7 Layers
 Open system inter connection

1.Application Layer (We can define HTTP/HTTPS) it works with request level
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session 
4. Transport Layer it will just receive the requrest (It's heart of OSI ) it's ot aware of the which request this will just forward the request to the some ip it's layer 4 
5. network Layer
6. DataLink Layer
7. Physical Layer



 Network Load Balancer :
#######################

- Opearates at the connection level (layer 4) routing connections to targets - Ec2 Instances or microservices, and containers within VPC based on IP protocal data
- Routes connections (requests) based on IP protocal (layer 4)
- Supports TCP/UDP protocals
- Is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maitaining ultra-low
- is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.

Application Load Balancer:
###########################


1. Supports with HTTP/HTTPS Requests
2. Opearates at request level routing the traffic to targets - Ec2 or Containers
3. Routes based on the content of the requests
4. Supports path based routing and host based routing


###############################


when we do the deploy of the application in private subnet
we will place one load balancer we will have listener
secure port 443
insure 80 


1. Target group is logical grouping the servers


1. We shold create the target group and place the logical group of the server where our application is hosted
2. we should create the LoadBalancer and we should target the traffic where our we create the target group


we we want to define the path based routing we should be creating one grouping of that target and we should targeting to that in the rules to navigate that traffic
1. we should create Application Load Balancer
2. We should Create the target groups according to the applicatin of grouping them
3. we should be creating the rules according to that path
4. we can have multiple path based routing also with single Load Balancer in layer 7

5. If we go for the kubernetes we can go for the Network Load Balancer - Ingress will take care of this request
