Relational DataBase Service
Offered by AWS

Presentation tier basically GUI


RDMS or SQL Data bases

Ex: MYSQL
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
PostGress
MariaDB
IBM DB2



The customer table contains data about the customer

Customer ID Primary Key
Customer Name

Cassandra. etc.


what is Relational DataBase?

A relatinal database (RDB) is a way of structuring information in tables, row and coloumns an relatinal database has the ability to establish links/relationalships between information by joining tables, which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relatinship between
various data points



Advantages or features of RDS:
###################################

You can use the database products you are already familar with : mariaDB,Microsoft SQL server MY SQL 
Amazon RDS manages backups, software patching automatic failure detectin, and recovery



RDS components:
#############

DB Engine it's a specific relational data base software


AutoScalling also available for the storage in RDS



We can run a DB instance on a virtual private cloud (VPC) using the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service.
when you use a VPC, you have control over your virtual networking envrionemnt you can choose your own ip address range create subnets and configure routing access control lists


we can use security also


Each RDS will get Endpoint (URL/Domain)

Primary --? Active
Standard By --? is active


- DB Failover
- DB Replication
- DB Availability
- Scalability
- Redentation
- Replication - we should
- Upgradation - we should

- RDS is a regional level service

Whenever upgradation required this will happen to stand-by-node later that will promote to the master 
stadby will become primary primary will become stadnby


ReadReplica's is introducted recently available in only few region in usa

For read the data can contact only in ReadReplica

Only write operations will happen in Primary


If we go for the multi agent means only one primary one stand-by
if we go for the multi deployment one primary multiple stand-by


#######################################################################


If we go for the Aurora it will give best perfomance


it supports multi region architecture
it's nt about multi availability zone amazon aura is supports for the multi region level

it supports only MySql or postgress 

Burstable classes means it will take more cpu even if we give also
Connectivity:

who can contact this RDS
Connect ec2 
Public access - Yes but not safe in realtime
mysql default port is 3306

RDS needs to improve

End Point

RDS is a relational data base



Initial database name means initiating the schema while creating the data base itself
