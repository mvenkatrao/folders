â€” As a DevOps engineer, my main roles and responsibilities include 
I automate manual processes using tools like scripts and configuration management tools to save time and reduce errors.
I create and maintain pipelines in Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying code changes.
I monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues to ensure smooth operation of applications and infrastructure.
I use Docker to package applications into containers, making them portable and scalable.
I work with cloud platforms like AWS to provision and manage infrastructure resources.
I collaborate with development and operations teams to streamline processes and improve efficiency.
I implement security best practices to protect systems and data from threats.
Overall, my goal is to improve the development and deployment process, ensuring that software is delivered quickly, reliably, and securely.




Implement Containerization with Docker:
--------------------------------------
Develop Dockerfiles and build Docker images for applications.
Manage Docker containers and ensure their efficient operation.
Optimize Docker images for size, security, and performance.

Deploy and Scale Kubernetes Clusters:
-------------------------------------
Configure and deploy Kubernetes clusters across different environments.
Scale Kubernetes clusters to accommodate varying workloads dynamically.

Manage Containerized Applications:
----------------------------------

Define Kubernetes manifests to deploy and manage applications.
Monitor and maintain the health and performance of containerized applications.

i'm the person who was the responsible for to take care of the repositories 

developing the dockerfiles and building the docker images for the applications.
 managing the docker containers and ensure their effiencet operations.
 i used to configuring and deploying the kubernetes across diffrenet environments
 and also taking care of the code quality analysis with sonarqube when it's not upto the mark of the threshold checking with the developers fixing them 

* monitoring and maintaing the pipelines if any  troubleshooting and fixing them
-- working with tickets like p1 p2 p3

Master -- dev -- QA -- PPD -- Prod
          |
          feature
          |
          dev

Feature branching strategy 
master and integrated branch long lived branches
master always points to the production
the total code is avaialbe in integration
to change the features we will create a branch from integration

git push

diffrence between fetch and pull 

fetch only it informes  


git merge and rebase

pre-commits hook and post commits hook


doing the certain task before the actions and after the actions

resolving conflicts
