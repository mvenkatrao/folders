Developing the Dockerfiles and build Docker Images for applications.
Managing the  Docker containers and ensure their efficient operation.
Optimize Docker images for size, security, and performance. (Remove unnecessary files and dependencies to reduce image size. Regularly update base images, scan for vulnerabilities, and minimize attack surface)
Configure and deploy Kubernetes clusters across different environments
Monitor and maintain the health and performance of containerized applications
I create and maintain pipelines in Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying code changes
I monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues to ensure smooth operation of applications and infrastructure

my name is venkat 
i have 5.10 years of experience as a devops engineer
the tools i was working with github as a source code manageemtn tools the build tool is maven and tomcat sonarqube for to analysis the code quality accuracy and nexus repository where we can store the artifactory and docker images and kubernetes and few of the aws services

when it comes to the roles and responsibilities


i was the respponsbile for to take care of the repositiories and working with developers when they had an issue
and i used to developing the dockerfiles and building the docker images for applications
and managing the dokcer containers and ensure their efficent operations as well
and also i usec to configuring the deplying the kuberentes scluster for diffrent environements
monitoring and mainting the applications and i used to take care of the sonarqube reports code quality '
i used to ake care of the sonarqube as part of the Countius integration
