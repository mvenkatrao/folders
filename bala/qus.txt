1. why we should use kubernetes?
2. what is the self healing in kubernetes?
3. is kubernetes is portable and how?
    -it can be deploy in any cloud and any OS
4. why do we use PODS?
    - Pod is kubernetes object where our application is running our container container is wrapped under pod
    - which is required cpu and memory
5. how kubernetes ensre the application for high avaialability ?
    - availability (livnesprobe readyness probe + supports horizontal pod scalling when we go for that supports the auto cluster auto scalling)
6. diffrence between kubernetes deployment and service?
   - service is like a load balancer which will manage by their labels to route the traffic to their nodes if there is any extenal cline to access it provides 3 types of services 
   - Deployment actually creates the pods where our applicatin be running 
     1. ClusterIP
     2. NodePort
     3. LoadBalancer
     4. Ingress Controller

7. any experience in upgrading the cluster?
  ex: 1.18. 2.21  current release
8. scalling ?
   1. vertical 
   2. Horizontal Pod scalling
   (cluster auto scalling)
9. what is the kuberentes namespace?
   basically to application isolation it's like cluster inside cluster
   - layer of isolation 
   logically isolation of environment and application  for their resources
10. what is PVC?
11. what is configMaps?
    when we want to refer the key value pair for the multiple pods or nodes
12. what service account?
         managing the authorization and authentication?  identification
13. deployment strategy?
14. what is the command for the deployment manually?
15. when do we use statefulset?
     - which is required to the data persistencey when we deploy a application as a statefulset that will be deploy with unique container and also it will get each pod will have one PVC as a unique and also that will create the container like 01 02 03 in this flow and also when container goes down that will create with same naming convention
16 . how do you secure the kuberentes cluster?
     - you instance should be in private vpc cidr and not exposing the unecessary ports securing not exposing the services unless it is must
     - RBAC (providing the only required access)
     - secrets and configMaps
