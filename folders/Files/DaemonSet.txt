if we create in DeamonSet -- every node will be having copy of the replica 
we can't define the replicas because it's like a global mode
---------------------------------------------------------------

diffrence between 

kubectl apply -- this is to create the pods and services
kubectl create -- if not existing it will create the resources
kubectl update -- if there is a change this will update
kubectl delete -- whatevert we have delete using apply this will delete all the resouces

  ex: kubectl delete -f filename
