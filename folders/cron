For example, if i want my trigger to fire on particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but dont' care what day of the week that happends to be, i would put 10 in the day of the month field and ? in the day of the week field.

if i want 3rd friday of the month can be indicated as 6#3

######   3rd saturday
         first should mention the 6#3 (first comes friday and 3rdfriday)
		 
		 
L (last) :: it has different meanings when used in vvarious fields, for example if it's applied in the day of the month field then it means last day of the month
