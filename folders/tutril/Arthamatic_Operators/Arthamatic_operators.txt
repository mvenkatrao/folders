Arthametic operators 

* shell script variables are default treated as strings, not numbers which adds some complexity to doing math in shell scirpt
* there are diffrent ways to perfome arithmetic operation :
     - using declare
     - using expr 
     - using let
above are the old model

below are the advance level arithmetic operators :

Using (()) (for integers)
using be (for integer and float numbers)


examples for modules ( or remainder )

#!/bin/bash

# Example 1: find the remainder when 14 is divided by 3
num1=14
num2=3
result=$((num1 % num2))
echo "The remainder when $num1 is divided by $num2 is $result."

# Example 2: find the remainder when 27 is divided by 4
num1=27
num2=4
result=$((num1 % num2))
echo "The remainder when $num1 is divided by $num2 is $result."

# Example 3: find the remainder when 39 is divided by 6
num1=39
num2=6
result=$((num1 % num2))
echo "The remainder when $num1 is divided by $num2 is $result."

output : 

The remainder when 14 is divided by 3 is 2.
The remainder when 27 is divided by 4 is 3.
The remainder when 39 is divided by 6 is 3.

 ((x++)) (this meaning adding one additional number to the variables for this value)
